Here I dump various creations I've made to make virtual flying easier.

AUTHENTIKIT S-MOD
Check out the fantastic DIY Spitfire controls on https://authentikit.org/ by Phil Hulme.
I have two of his parts to make the spade grip mount 90 degrees instead of the original 45 degrees.


WarBRD Extrusion mount 
I made a mount to be able to mount my Virpil WarBRD to 3060 extrusions.
